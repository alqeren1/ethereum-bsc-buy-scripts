# Ethereum & BSC Token Buyer Scripts

[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-blue.svg)](LICENSE.txt)

This repository contains Python scripts from 4 years ago designed to interact with the Ethereum and Binance Smart Chain (BSC) networks by me. Their primary purpose is to enable rapid token purchases at launch. Please note that the code may be disorganized and might require updates to work with current libraries and network changes.

## Overview

These scripts automate the process of buying tokens quickly on launch. They interact with both Ethereum and BSC via Web3 and related libraries. Given their age, some parts may not follow modern best practices.

## Features

- **Blockchain Interaction:** Scripts that communicate with Ethereum and BSC networks.
- **Automated Token Purchase:** Designed to execute token purchases rapidly at launch.
- **Basic Error Handling:** Simple mechanisms for transaction monitoring and error handling.

## Requirements

- **Python:** Version 3.x (preferably 3.7 or higher)
- **Libraries:** 
  - `web3.py` (ensure compatibility with your Python version)
  - `selenium`
  - `smtplib`

## Setup

1. **Clone the Repository:**

  ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/alqeren1/ethereum-bsc-token-buyer-scripts.git
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**
   
   - Install the required libraries

4. **Configuration:**

   - Update configuration variables or files with your Ethereum/BSC node endpoints and wallet credentials.
   - **Security Notice:** Ensure your private keys are stored securely and never hard-coded in the scripts.

## Usage

Run the desired script using Python. For example:

   ```bash
   python script_name.py
   ```

Replace `script_name.py` with the appropriate file name.
